Here's the complete code and instructions for running a simple Python FastAPI application in a Docker container on Ubuntu:

1. Install Docker:

   If you haven't already installed Docker on your Ubuntu machine, follow the steps mentioned in the previous response to install Docker.

2. Create a FastAPI Application:

   Create a FastAPI application in a Python script. You can use the following simple "Hello, World!" FastAPI app.

   ```python
   # app.py
   from fastapi import FastAPI

   app = FastAPI()

   @app.get("/")
   def read_root():
       return {"message": "Hello, World!"}
   ```

3. Create a Dockerfile:

   Create a Dockerfile in the same directory as your FastAPI application with the following content:

   ```Dockerfile
   # Use the official Python image as a parent image
   FROM python:3.9

   # Set the working directory in the container
   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy the requirements file into the container
   COPY requirements.txt .

   # Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
   RUN pip install fastapi uvicorn

   # Copy your FastAPI application code into the container
   COPY app.py .

   # Expose port 8000 for the FastAPI application
   EXPOSE 8000

   # Command to run the FastAPI application using Uvicorn
   CMD ["uvicorn", "app:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
   ```

4. Create a requirements.txt file:

   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content, listing FastAPI and Uvicorn as dependencies:

   ```
   fastapi
   uvicorn
   ```

5. Build the Docker Image:

   In your terminal, navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and your FastAPI application, and run the following command to build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t fastapi-app .
   ```

6. Run the Docker Container:

   Run a Docker container from the built image, mapping port 8000:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8000:8000 fastapi-app
   ```

7. Access Your FastAPI App:

   Open a web browser or use `curl` to make a GET request to http://localhost:8000. You should see the "Hello, World!" message in the response.

This code and the accompanying instructions will help you run a simple Python FastAPI application in a Docker container on Ubuntu.
